Configure FVM and IDEs for better support for different development environments.

## Project

FVM will create a relative symlink in your project from `.fvm/flutter_sdk` to the cache of the selected version. Add it to your `.gitignore`

```yaml title=".gitignore"
.fvm/flutter_sdk
```

## FVM

### Cache Directory

You can configure the **fvm** cache directory by setting `FVM_HOME` environment variable. If nothing is set the default **fvm** path will be used. You are also able to change the directory by setting the `--cache-path` on the config. See below

### Config

There are some configurations which you can change on FVM. **All settings set on CLI are compatible with the Sidekick(GUI)**.

### Different Flutter Repo

You can use a different Flutter repo, a fork or as a local cache, by setting the `FVM_GIT_CACHE` environment variable.

#### List config

```bash
> fvm config
```

#### Set cache path

Location where Flutter SDK versions will be stored. If nothing is set, the default will be used.

```bash
> fvm config --cache-path <CACHE_PATH>
```

## IDE

:::info
You might have to restart your IDE and the Flutter debugger to make sure it uses the latest version of the configurations in some situations.
:::

### VS Code

#### Option 1 - Automatic Switching (Recommended)

You can add the version symlink for a dynamic switch. VS Code will always use the version selected within the project for all IDE tooling. Also, remove the flutter SDK from search to make things easier.

```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
{
  "dart.flutterSdkPath": ".fvm/flutter_sdk",
  // Remove .fvm files from search
  "search.exclude": {
    "**/.fvm": true
  },
  // Remove from file watching
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/.fvm": true
  }
}
```

#### Option 2 - View all SDKs (Manual switching)

VSCode has the ability for you to switch between all cached Flutter SDKs using `Flutter: Change SDK`.

:::info

Use command `fvm list` to show you the cache path to the versions.
:::

#### List all versions installed by FVM

You can see all the versions installed by FVM in VS Code by just providing path to `versions` directory:

```json
{
  "dart.flutterSdkPaths": ["/Users/usr/fvm/versions"]
}
```

Alternatively, you can specify only selected versions. The following snippet will cause VS Code to show only `stable` and `dev` versions of Flutter.

```json
{
  "dart.flutterSdkPaths": [
    "/Users/usr/fvm/versions/stable",
    "/Users/usr/fvm/versions/dev"
  ]
}
```

To change current Flutter version open a project and select `Flutter: Change SDK` in the command palette. You should see all the versions as depicted in the following screenshot.

### Android Studio

1. Go to `Languages & Frameworks > Flutter` or search for Flutter and change Flutter SDK path.
2. Copy the **_absolute_** path of fvm symbolic link in your root project directory. Example: `/absolute-project-path/.fvm/flutter_sdk`
3. Apply the changes.
4. Restart Android Studio to see the new settings applied.

:::important
For Android Studio to detect the dynamic change of SDKs, the installed SDK must have finished setup.

Using `fvm install <VERSION>` will ensure that setup during install.

If you have intalled through another command and setup was not completed. You can finish by just running `fvm flutter --version`

Android Studio might take a few seconds to detect the dynamic SDK change.
